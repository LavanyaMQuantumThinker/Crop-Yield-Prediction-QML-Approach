# Quantum Machine Learning for Crop Yield Prediction


ABSTRACT
As global food demands continue to rise, precision agriculture has emerged as a pivotal approach for maximizing crop productivity while minimizing resource usage. Crop yield prediction Plays A critical role in this context, enabling informed decisions for farm planning, resource allocation, and market forecasting. Traditional machine learning models, while useful, often struggle with the increasing complexity and volume of agricultural data. This chapter explores the integration of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) techniques in crop yield prediction, highlighting how quantum computing principles such as superposition, entanglement, and quantum parallelism can provide exponential advantages in model training and optimization. We review the limitations of classical models in large-scale, non-linear agricultural datasets and present a quantum- enhanced framework using algorithms such as Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVM) and Variational Quantum Classifiers (VQC) for improved predictive accuracy. Real-time sensor data, satellite imagery, and weather records are used as key data inputs, with a focus on encoding these inputs into quantum-compatible formats using quantum feature maps. The chapter also introduces hybrid quantum-compatible formats using quantum feature maps. The chapter also introduces hybrid quantum-classical models that leverage Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices for current implement ability. Through case studies and simulation results, we demonstrate the potential of QML in transforming agricultural decision-making and promoting sustainable food systems. The chapter concludes with challenges, future research directions, and a roadmap for integrating quantum learning pipelines with existing smart farming infrastructure.
